# README Generator
  ## Description
  README Generator creates a professional README file for anyone looking to mitigate time spent on creating one from scratch!
  This application is able to create the following based on user-input:
  * Project Title
  * Sectioned content such as Description, Requirements, Installation, Usage, Credits and Questions
  * Creates a link to your GitHub webpage



  ## Requirements
  Github Profile/Username, Node.js, Git, and a Code Editor (VS Code for example)
  


  ## Installation
  To pull the environment onto your side you can do the following:

1.) Copy the SSH or HTTPS Key for the Repository by selecting the green "Code" button

2.) Go to Git or GitBash to clone the repo by entering the following into the command terminal:

git clone git@github.com:profile-name/repo-name.git

or in this case for this particular repo:

git@github.com:AegeanGrey/readme-generator.git

3.) navigate to the file path and type the following to open the code:

code .
  
We will then need to install the required packages/modules for the README Generator to work:

4.) In the Code Editor, right click on the 'index.js' file and select 'Open in Integrated Terminal'

5.) In the Terminal, type in the following to install the required packages:

npm i
  


  ## Usage
1.) Type the following into the Terminal to run the application:

node index.js run

2.) You should then see a series of individual prompts display asking the following questions:

* What is your Github Username?
* What is the title of your project?
* How would you describe this project?
* What are the prerequisites the user should have beforehand?
* How do you install this project?
* How do you use this project?
* Who contributed in creating this project?
* What is the best email to contact you regarding further questions?

3.) After answering all the prompts, the README file is then generated! I would recommend double checking punctuation and modify the generated README file to your liking!
